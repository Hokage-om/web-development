            <li>Class Selector :-</li>
            <h3> What is a class selector in CSS? In CSS, a class selector is formatted as a period (.) character followed by the name of the class. It selects all elements with that class attribute so that unique CSS declarations can be applied to those specific elements without affecting other elements on the page.</h3>

            <h3>The CSS grouping selector is used to select multiple elements and style them together. This reduces the code and extra effort to declare common styles for each element. To group selectors, each selector is separated by a space.</h3>
